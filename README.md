*Note* When using nano as my texteditor on my MacBook, an invisible linefeed(lf) is added behind each IP address. This causes the behavior of a "?" being placed behind the file name. By opening the file with Notepad++, I was able to remove the lf and the "?" was not added to the exported filename. 

**shout out to my friend Halim @ https://www.linkedin.com/in/halim-boumedjirek-28b6a92/ for helping me identify that problem**
